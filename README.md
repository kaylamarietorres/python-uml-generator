# 🏛️ python-uml-generator
Automatically generate UML class diagrams and architecture diagrams from Python codebases.

## 📓 Overview

`python-uml-generator` is an open source tool designed to help developers **reverse-engineer UML diagrams** from their Python projects. By analyzing the codebase, it creates **class diagrams**, **module dependency graphs**, and optionally **sequence diagrams**, making it easier to understand, document, and communicate software architecture.

This project is ideal for:

* Students learning object-oriented programming in Python.
* Teams who want **quick architectural overviews** of large Python projects.
* Open source maintainers who need to **document their projects** for contributors.

## ✨ Features

* **Class Diagram Extraction**: Generate UML diagrams from classes, methods, and attributes.
* **Module-Level Graphs**: Visualize relationships between Python modules/packages.
* **Sequence Diagrams**: Trace call flows during execution.
* **Multiple Output Formats**: Export diagrams to **PlantUML**, **Mermaid**, or **Graphviz**.
* **VS Code Integration (planned)**: Generate diagrams directly from within your editor.

## 🚀 Getting Started
